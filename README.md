Task 1 



ðŸš€ Responsive Landing Page | Prodigy Infotech



 ðŸ’» Tech Stack: HTML | CSS | JavaScript



I built a responsive landing page with a dynamic navigation bar that enhances user experience. The navbar includes Home and multiple sections, where:

ðŸ”¹ Hovering over menu items changes colors ðŸŽ¨ for better interactivity.

 ðŸ”¹ Clicking on a menu item smoothly scrolls to its respective section.

 ðŸ”¹ The page is fully responsive ðŸ“±ðŸ’», ensuring a seamless experience across devices.



This project helped me improve my frontend skills and gain hands-on experience in JavaScript-based interactivity. Excited to keep building more! ðŸš€
